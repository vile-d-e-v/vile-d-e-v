Hello, i am vileDev. I am an ameateur programmer working on a personal passion project with a close friend of mine. I am also an artist and writer! I love creating stories and lore. I'm also trying to create music.
My dream is to make games for everyone to enjoy and remember for their storytellings and gameplays.
I also want to inspire people. No matter what background, no matter what identity, no matter how many personal mental health issues, I think anyone can use and train their creative minds in one way or another.
I want to be someone who gives people an escape when they play my games, even if it's just for a little bit. I want to be a decent example!
Creativity and hope is what makes us human. Let's keep it that way!

he/they. INTP. sensitive to sound. i might rarely be confused with online sarcasm/jokes via text, so make sure to clarify for me if you think i might get confused.

I'm happy to help with small projects in a relaxed environment. I don't think I can handle deadlines yet regarding my current personal life, so keep this in mind.
